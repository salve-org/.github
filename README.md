# `Salve Organization`

`Salve Organization` is an organization that provides nice and easy to use tools for code editors made with Python. The projects from Salve Organization are focused on making good API's with high flexibility and very simple usage. As more time goes on these projects will become easier to use and we welcome contributions especially for projects like `Albero` which require special custom-made mappings.
